Declaring a Method
Line 6
is an end-of-line comment indicating the purpose of lines 7–10 of the program. Line 7
is the starting point of every Java application. The parentheses after the identifier main indicate that it’s a program building block called a method. Java class declarations normally
contain one or more methods. For a Java application, one of the methods must be called
main and must be defined as shown in line 7; otherwise, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
will not execute the application. Methods perform tasks and can return information when
they complete their tasks. We’ll explain the purpose of keyword static in Section 3.2.5.
Keyword void indicates that this method will not return any information. Later, we’ll see
how a method can return information. For now, simply mimic main’s first line in your
Java applications. In line 7, the String[] args in parentheses is a required part of the
method main’s declaration—we discuss this in Chapter 7.
The left brace in line 8 begins the body of the method declaration. A corresponding
right brace must end it (line 10). Line 9 in the method body is indented between the
braces.
Good Programming Practice 2.3
Indent the entire body of each class declaration one “level” between the left brace and the
right brace that delimit the body of the class. This format emphasizes the class declaration’s
structure and makes it easier to read. We use three spaces to form a level of indent—many
programmers prefer two or four spaces. Whatever you choose, use it consistently.
Error-Prevention Tip 2.2
When you type an opening left brace, {, immediately type the closing right brace, }, then
reposition the cursor between the braces and indent to begin typing the body. This practice
helps prevent errors due to missing braces. Many IDEs insert the closing right brace for
you when you type the opening left brace.
Common Programming Error 2.3
It’s a syntax error if braces do not occur in matching pairs.
Good Programming Practice 2.4
IDEs typically indent code for you. The Tab key may also be used to indent code. You can
configure each IDE to specify the number of spaces inserted when you press Tab.
// main method begins execution of Java application
public static void main(String[] args)
2.2 Your First Program in Java: Printing a Line of Text 39
Performing Output with System.out.println
Line 9
instructs the computer to perform an action—namely, to display the characters contained
between the double quotation marks (the quotation marks themselves are not displayed).
Together, the quotation marks and the characters between them are a string—also known
as a character string or a string literal. White-space characters in strings are not ignored
by the compiler. Strings cannot span multiple lines of code.
The System.out object—which is predefined for you—is known as the standard
output object. It allows a Java application to display information in the command
window from which it executes. In recent versions of Microsoft Windows, the command
window is the Command Prompt. In UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X, the command window is
called a terminal window or a shell. Many programmers call it simply the command line.
Method System.out.println displays (or prints) a line of text in the command
window. The string in the parentheses in line 9 is the argument to the method. When
System.out.println completes its task, it positions the output cursor (the location where
the next character will be displayed) at the beginning of the next line in the command
window. This is similar to what happens when you press the Enter key while typing in a
text editor—the cursor appears at the beginning of the next line in the document.
The entire line 9, including System.out.println, the argument "Welcome to Java
Programming!" in the parentheses and the semicolon (;), is called a statement. A method
typically contains one or more statements that perform its task. Most statements end with
a semicolon. When the statement in line 9 executes, it displays Welcome to Java Programming! in the command window.
When learning how to program, sometimes it’s helpful to “break” a working program
so you can familiarize yourself with the compiler’s syntax-error messages. These messages do
not always state the exact problem in the code. When you encounter an error, it will give you
an idea of what caused it. [Try removing a semicolon or brace from the program of Fig. 2.1,
then recompile the program to see the error messages generated by the omission.]
Using End-of-Line Comments on Right Braces for Readability
As an aid to programming novices, we include an end-of-line comment after a closing
brace that ends a method declaration and after a closing brace that ends a class declaration.
For example, line 10
Good Programming Practice 2.5
Indent the entire body of each method declaration one “level” between the braces that define the body of the method. This makes the structure of the method stand out and makes
the method declaration easier to read.
System.out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!");
Error-Prevention Tip 2.3
When the compiler reports a syntax error, it may not be on the line that the error message
indicates. First, check the line for which the error was reported. If you don’t find an error
on that line, check several preceding lines.
